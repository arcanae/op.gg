# op.gg

This is my 1st project for **Simplon.co**.    
The objective is to recreate a page from a website of our choice.    
The one I choosed is [op.gg](https://euw.op.gg/)'s home page.     

We have to recreate it using our own knowledge, not just by simply copying it from the page code.   
We need to use :   

 - [x] an image
 - [x] flexboxes
 - [x] forms
 - [x] links
